###Analysing how Mental Health Issues correlate to CGPA###

Students not only sacrifice their sleep, food, and all other activities, to devote themselves to academics, leaving their well-being and mental health behind. Peer pressure, combined with unrealistic academic deadlines and outputs, unworkable teams, and competitive spirit at the very age where our urge for self-discovery peaks. This leads to the mental burden, and stress if not well-taken care can end up with chronic anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.

To find out whether students' mental health affects their CGPA, we set out to ask some questions, our obvious choice was Reddit, where millions of users, can be chosen from specific demographics. We made a questionnaire using Google Forms, and uploaded them on the subreddit r/India, and also crossposted them on different subreddits, we also shared the questionnaire with our friends in the college to get their responses.
